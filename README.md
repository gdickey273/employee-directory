  ## Usage
  
  Upon navigating to the application the user will be directed to the About page (where they can follow links to hear our newest release). They can then use the navbar to navigate to the Band Members page where they can view a table of basic member data. The user can click on any of the table column headers to sort by that field. The user can also use the input text box above the table to filter data by member name (first or last);
